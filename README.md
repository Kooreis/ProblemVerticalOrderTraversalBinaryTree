# Question: How do you implement an algorithm to perform vertical order traversal of a binary tree? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided defines a binary tree and implements an algorithm for vertical order traversal of the tree. The binary tree is defined using a Node class for individual nodes and a BinaryTree class for the tree itself. Each node has a data property and left and right properties for its child nodes. The BinaryTree class has a root property for the root node and a method for vertical order traversal. The verticalOrderTraversal method first checks if the root node exists. If it does, it initializes a map to store nodes at each horizontal distance and a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. The root node is added to the queue with a horizontal distance of 0. The method then enters a loop that continues until all nodes have been visited. In each iteration, it removes the next node from the queue and adds it to the map at its horizontal distance. If the node has a left child, it adds the child to the queue with a horizontal distance one less than its parent. If the node has a right child, it adds the child to the queue with a horizontal distance one more than its parent. After all nodes have been visited, the method sorts the keys in the map and prints the nodes at each horizontal distance in order from left to right. This ensures that the vertical order traversal is performed correctly.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the algorithm used to solve the problem. Both versions use a breadth-first search approach to traverse the binary tree and a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. They also both use a map or hash table to store nodes at each horizontal distance or column.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions:

1. TypeScript uses static typing: In the TypeScript version, types are explicitly declared for variables and function return values. For example, the `verticalOrder` function is declared to return an array of arrays of numbers (`number[][]`), and the `columnTable` variable is declared as an object with number keys and array of number values (`{ [key: number]: number[] }`). This can help prevent bugs and improve code readability.

2. Different data structures for storing nodes: The JavaScript version uses a `Map` to store nodes at each horizontal distance, while the TypeScript version uses a plain object (`{ [key: number]: number[] }`). This doesn't affect the functionality of the code, but it does show a different way of handling the same problem.

3. Different ways of handling optional parameters in class constructors: In the JavaScript version, the `Node` class constructor assigns `null` to `this.left` and `this.right` if no value is provided. In the TypeScript version, the `TreeNode` class constructor uses optional parameters and assigns default values if no value is provided.

4. Different ways of generating the final result: The JavaScript version sorts the keys of the map and then logs the values. The TypeScript version tracks the minimum and maximum column numbers and then pushes the values in the `columnTable` to the `result` array in order. This results in the TypeScript version returning an array of arrays, while the JavaScript version logs the output directly.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a depth-first search approach to traverse the binary tree, which is different from the JavaScript version that uses a breadth-first search approach. The C++ version uses a recursive function `getVerticalOrder` to visit each node and its children, while the JavaScript version uses a while loop and a queue to visit each node.

In terms of data structures, both versions use a map to store nodes at each horizontal distance. However, the C++ version uses a `std::map`, which is an ordered map, so the keys are automatically sorted in ascending order. This eliminates the need to sort the keys manually as in the JavaScript version.

The C++ version also uses a `std::vector` to store the nodes at each horizontal distance, which is similar to the array used in the JavaScript version. However, the C++ version uses the `push_back` method to add elements to the vector, while the JavaScript version uses the `push` method to add elements to the array.

In terms of output, the C++ version uses `std::cout` to print the vertical order traversal, while the JavaScript version uses `console.log`.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses pointers to link nodes in the binary tree, while the JavaScript version uses object references. The C++ version also uses iterators to iterate over the map, while the JavaScript version uses a for-of loop to iterate over the keys of the map.
